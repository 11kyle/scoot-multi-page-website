## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (Tailwind)
- Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Figma] (https://figma.com/) - Design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) - Components

### Challenges

Absolute position content on the right without overflow-x-hidden was causing the width to expand. I realized I needed to add overflow-x-hidden to the html and body tags.

I had one of those pesky typo bugs. I had a line-height value of 4px instead of 40px.

### Continued development

CSS Grid - I super confident with Flexbox but still need to work with grids more.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - Possible the best overall place to get help from the community. You can find a solution to every problem you face and if not, post your own.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs are great for reminding you everything you forget. I often use it to look up attributes for html tags and JavaScript methods.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This is the documentation for TailwindCSS. It's always open when I use it as my CSS framework.
